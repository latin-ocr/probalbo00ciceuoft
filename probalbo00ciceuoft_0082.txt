concise, and he possessed great powers of wit and repartee.

(2) M. Licinius Crassus, surnamed Dives, or The Rich, overthrew
Spartacus and his gladiators in 71. As his victory was over slaves, he was
rewarded, not with a triumph, but with an ovation. He was consul
with Pompey in 70 Bc, and together with Caesar and Pompey formed
the first triumvirate in 60 ac. In 55 he received the province of
syria. and set out for the East, although the omens were unfavourable.
In a battle against the Parthians near Carrhae, the Romans were de-
feated with great slaughter, and Crassus himself was killed shortly
afterwards. He was not a brilliant orator, but was careful and pains-
taking in preparing his speeches. He was one of the counsel for
Balbus, his colleagues being Pompey and Cicero.

triumvir (2), took the command in Spain for several years after hjs
consulship. He was honoured with a triumph B.c. 93, for his suc-
cesses against the Lusitanian tribes. In B.c. 89 he was censor together

rolled in new tribes certain of the Latini and Itali, who were rewarded
