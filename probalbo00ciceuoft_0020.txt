10 ⁴CICERO PRO BALBO.

issue, and has been devoted to excit-,ing sympathy with ⁷
Balbus and Pompey. The remaining sections are occupied
by special arguments.

§§19-22. It is not true that no citizen of a civitas
foederata may benefit by the Lem Gellia except by consent
of his own state. ἐξ 22-26. It is lawful to enfranchise
even slaves ; much more so to reward deserving aliens by
what they covet most. ἐξ 27-31. It has always been
understood that any alien might acquire the Roman
franchise if Rome was willing to give it. The only
condition of its tenure is that no one may be at once
a citizen of Rome and of another state. ἓξ 32-37. Special
clauses in treaties against an alien receiving the civitas
Romana· only prove that, otherwise, Rome may bestow it
at pleasure‚ even if the Lem Gellia does not override any
such clause. At any rate, the foedus with Gades is not
sacrosanct, so that the Lete Gellia certainly oven-ides this
particular foeda-3. ἐξ 38-44. The Gaditani are doing all
they can to help Balbus’ claim. ἐξ 45-51. And there are
many and unquestioned instances of aetion exactly similar*
to that of Pompey in this case. ἓξ 52-55. No such gift
of the civitas has ever been revoked‚ and there are special
facilities for its acquirement both in law and custom.
ἐξ 55 adfin. This prosecution is entirely due to envy of
Balbus and Pompey. It is time such envy ceased. Cicero
himself has set the example by forgiving his most
powerful politica] enemies.
