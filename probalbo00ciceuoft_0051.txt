nores. 41

ᾧ 18. adgrediar: this is the subjunct. after priusquam, because
there is a notion of purpose. If a fact merely were intended to be
expressed, the indic. would be used.

jus causamque: the speech is to be dividcd into two parts, one

dealing with the law of legal arguments, and the other applying the
law to the facts of the case.

Corneli : i.e.‚ L. Cornelius Balbus, the defendant.

nostrum ι nostrum is the partitive genitive ς in other cases nostri is
used. ,vostri is really the gen. ncut. of the adj. noster, and means
“ of our nature‚'’ ‘⁴ of our condition.’' The only exception to this
rule (it is an apparent, not a real exception) is that with omnium
you must have nostram, not nostri, although the meaning is posses-
sive, αφ, “Patria est communis omnium nostrum parens.’' The
explanation is that onmium brings out the distributive or partitive
meaning of nos ‚· in “ all of us ’' (nostrum onmium) nostrum can scarcely
be partitive, but in quisque nostrum we have a true instance of a
partitive gen.

nascendi initio: lit. “at the beginning of being born,’' i.e.‚ “at
birth.”

deberet, &c. ε notice the subjunctives deberet, afficiendi essent after
si, in this sentence, and the indic. consecuta est after sin in the next
sentence. In the one sentence a condition or supposition is more
prominently put forward, in the other a statement of a fact.

humanitas: see note, ᾗ 13.

intellego: the apodosis in this sentence is in the indic., whereas in
the previous sentence, videretur, the apodosis, is in the subj . The
reason is that the verb in the apodosis follows the mood of the verb in
the protasis. (In a conditional sentence the “ if‘' clause is called the
protasis, and the other clause the apodosis.)

genere: “ descent‚” “birth”

laggai-lizinio fortunae gradu: “fr0m the lowest rung of fortune’s

honores ε there is no need to supply summos from summam ,· summos
honores could only mean the consulship and higher offices of state,
which as a fact Balbus had not yet obtained. Honores, however, i.e.,
“ positione of dignity,’' he had frequently occupied.

adjutura: adjuvo is used to express every kind of help or support3
