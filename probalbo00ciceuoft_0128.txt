estimate of the speaker himself, a more elaborate exposition
of the case and the charge. 3. So that I am now assured that
that is true in saying which some devoted to literature and
philosophica] studies were 111011υ111 to state a paradox, namely
that 611 116 (1063 turns out w 611101 the man who has thoroughly
grasped in his mind all the virtues. Itor wh· at greater rich-
nes s, variety, fulness, could have been exhibited by Q. s„
Ciass us—a man natiirally gifted with singular powers of
oratory—had he heen 1116111100 this cause, than was exhiiited
by him, who could only allow to the study of this art, from
his boyhood till 116 reached his present age, the time during
which he has rested from successive wars and victorias?
4. And on this account my duty of winding up this case is
made more difficult. For I have to follow a speech which
has not been borne past your ears, but has rooted itself deep
in the minds of you all, so that you can derive more pleasure

this seems to me 10 116 due to the surpassing glory of this
eminent man 3 this seems to 1116 essential to the performance
of your duty, this seems to ine 6 sufficient pica, that all
should admit that Cn. Pompeius had a right to do whatever
it is known that he has done. For nothing is more true than
11161, which he himself said yesterday, that L. Cornelius was
contending for all his fortune& while he was called to account
on no particular charge. For they do not essert that he
obtained his citizenship in any clandestine way, or that he

sheltered himself under any shameless falsehood, 01·ι that he
crept by stealth into 'the censor’s lists: this only is alleged
against him, that 116 was born at Gades, and this no one
