cotidie: in dies = “ increasing or decreasing day by day ”; eotidi(
d= “every day‚'' or “daily‚'’ without any reference to increase or
ecrease.

consequantur: the subjunet. seems unnecessary here; it may be
explained perhaps as a generic subjunctive.

ex nobilissimo civi: ea: = “ out of‚'' ‘⁶ after having been, '' a most
distinguished citizen. Cic-2· is the abl.; the termination i is more
common in Cicero than the termination -ε,

ᾁ44. afficiantur: in Cicero qnamqmmz is followedby the indic„
and quamvis by the subjunctive. Α Here tgffieiaietm· is in the subjunc-
tive because it expresses a presumed opinion ol' the Gaditani, and not
simply because it is governed by quamquam.

praesentis, ignorantis: accusatives.

quo de jure, &ez i.e., “numquam omnino esse dubitatum de eo
jure de quo hoc judicium constitutum sit.’'

Cap. XX. de iure praediatorio ε a praediacor was a “ purchaser of
mortgaged estates sold at auction” (praedia), “a dealerin landed
estatesfl A praedium was a property which was made a security to
the state by a praes (⁵‘surety,” “ bail”). Hence it came to mean
land generally. The whole law relating to the praes, praedium,
and praedz'ator was called ins pramliatorz'ecm.

birthplace Arpinum, and was perhaps a distant family connexion.
He· is the only great democratic leader whom Cicero consistently
praises.

summa Virtute: one MS. omits summa, but praeditus virtute with-
out a qualifying adjective is not good Ciceronian Latin. A man of
valour cannot be translated by homo virtute ,· a qualifying adjective,
such as mayn« cr summa, must necessarily be added.

cohortem: a cohort contained three maniplos, and each maniple
contained two comm-ies. A legion consisted of 10 eohorts = 30
maniplos = 60 eenturies = about 5000 or 6000 men and Officers.

demned without Marius' act also being condemned ἓ ”
§ 47. imperitum, rudem, ignarum : au govern the genit.
