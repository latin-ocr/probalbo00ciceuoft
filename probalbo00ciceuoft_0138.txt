For not without cause in the case of Cn. Publicius Menan-
der, a freed man, whom, in the days of our ancestors, our
ambassadors, when setting out for Grecce, wished to take with
them as interpreter, was it proposed to the people, that if
this Publicius revisited his home and thence returned to
Rome, he should none the less be a citizen. Many Roman
citizens, too, in the records of the past, of their own free-
will, uncondemned and without detriment, left this republic
and betook themselves to other states.

XII. 29. But if it is lawful for a Roman citizen that one
should be a Gaditane, either by exile, or by right of subsequent
return, or by giving up our citizenship—to come now to the

so, in the Greek states, we see that Athenians‚ Rhodians,
Lacedaemoniam, all others from every state are enrolled, and
that the same men are citizens of many states. And I
have seen at Athens nien unversed in the laW, citizens of*
ours, led astray by a mistake on this point, included among
the jurors and the Areopagites, having their tribe and number
definitely assigned to them, who did not know that, if they
had obtained civil rights there, they had lost them here, unless
