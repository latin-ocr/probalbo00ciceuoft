nores. 63

‘by ιή with the accusative ι the abl. here expresses the place or extent
of the overflow.

pecuniam : governed by ridebalis.

luxuriam ξ also governcd by videbatis.

non aliquo : in negative sentences qaisquam and nllus are generally
used instead of aliquis = “any ''; herc, however, uliquis does not
mean ‘⁶ any‚'’ but ‘⁴ some special.'’

Tusculanum: sc.p1·‹7e(lit(m, “his cstate m· country house at Tus-
culum.'' Rich parvcnus often aroused great jealousy by buying up
the old family mansions and estates of distinguished peoplc. Cicero

himself incurred some ill-will in this way. Tusculanum is also
governed by virlebatc'x.

Crassum emisse and (Tusculanum) pervenisse depend on non
temnat.

non tenebat: = non tenebat in memoria, opp. to meminerat. He
remembered that the estate belonged to Metellus and Crassus, but
did not remember how it came to belong to them.

praediorum nullam esse gentem: “that there was no family de-
scent in estat(›s‚'' 17.e., in Rome estates were alienable, could be sold
to any one ; they were not entailed, or bound as a matter of necessity
and of law to descend from father to son and always remain in the
same family.

tutelas: tutela was tho right and power of being the guardian of
one who, on account of his age, could not look after himself. Parents
had the right of appointing tutore-s, or ‘⁶ guardians‚'’ by will: the
nearest kinsmen were usually appointed guardians, and it· they were
passed over, it was regarded as a slight upon their character. The
power of appointing tutores was regulated by statute.

ᾗ 57. Clustuminam : The ancient tribes were all named after noble
houses. The Crustumine or Clustumine, so called from the Sabine
town Crustumerium, was the first to be described by a local name.
It was added in 495, when the tribes were increased from 20 to 21 ;
-eventually‚ in 241, there were 35 tribes. It was more honourable to
belong to an old than to a more recently enrolled tribe, and also
more honourable to belong to a rustic than to a city tribe.

legis de ambitu : ambitus strictly means “going round²' (ambi, eo)
for the purpose of canvassing. In order to obtain office at Rome the
candidate had to canvass the electors, and often resortcd to bribery
and corruption. A lex de ambitu corresponds to our Corrupt Practices
Act. One of the penalties for violating the law was incapacitation from
being a candidate for ten years. A successful prosecution for bribery
enabled the prosecutor to become a member of the tribe of the defen-
dant, if the defendant's tribe was more honour-able than his own.
This mode of promotion, Cicero contende, is the least invidious.

praetoriam sententiam: the members of the senate were classed
