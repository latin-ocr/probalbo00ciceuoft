60 CICERO PRO BALBO.

utinam possent: utinam with past tenses os the subjunct. ex-

presses a wish that cannot be fulfilled, with present tenses a wish
that can be fulfilled.

contra: adv.‚ = ‘⁴ on the other hand‚'’ and not a prep. governing
oppuqnatores.
exterminari: in the literal sense of ex and terminus = “.¹'‘0 be driven

out of the ends or limits of a country.'' The meaning “ to exter-
minate '⁵ or “ destroy’' is derived from this.

ille summus poeta noster: Ennius. Notiee the use of ille = “that
famous man.'' Cp. Alexander ille = ‘⁴ the great Alexander.”

magis Hannibalis quam communem imperatoriam: notice the
genitive Hannibalis corresponding to the adjectives communem impera-
toriam. Ennius did not intend the exhortation to be the thought of
Hannibal rather than the common thought of all generals.

Carthaginiensis: a Carthaginian, z'.e., a friend, whether as a matter
of fact he be a Roman or Spaniard or not z——those who help me to kill
my enemies I esteem as my friends.

cujatis: “ of what country.” Besides the form emotis, -is, there
is another form, etym, -αῑίε, Reid reads,--“ Hostem qui feriet, erit ‚
inquit, mihi Karthaginiensis, quisquis erit. Cujus civitatis sit, id
habent hodie leve, et semper habuerunt.'’ With this reading the
quotation ends at quisquis erit, and Cicero goes on, “ What country a
man may belong to, to-day they consider it a light matter, and have
always so considered it '’ ; id refers to eujus civitatis sit. With
Teubner’s text either id or hoe is superfluous, and here too id or Ιιο c
refers to cujatis siet ,· siet is the old uncontracted form of sit. The
subjunctive seems strange beside the future indic. erit, but the sligh t
difference in meaning expressed is easily seen.

Cap. XXHL, ᾧ 52. Dabo etiam : “ I will add also.”

jgdiocunil: genit. depending on interpretationem Juris ao foederum
un ers 00 .

quaestioni: quaestiones = generally “quaestiones perpetuae,'’ or
“standing courts,'’ but it is uncertain whether there was a special
court for cases of citizenship.

prae se ferrent : prae se ferre = “to carry before one's-se1f‚” as if
to show it, hence = “to show,” “ display.”

Mamertinis repetentibus: “the Mamertines claiming him back
as their citizen ’' ; cp. ᾧ 38. ’1,

,ἐῢ de hgivitate accusatus: ‘⁴ was prosecuted on the subject of his
ci izens p.

factus esset: the subjunctive after quod expressing the reason;
see Gn, ᾧῷ 487, 488.

§53. quem constaret: the subject of constaret is quem donatum
