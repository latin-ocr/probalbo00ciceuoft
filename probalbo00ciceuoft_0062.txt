52 eiCERo PRO BALBO.

principes were called antepilano, and (3) the triarii, consisting of
tried veterans. Centurio primi pili was ‘⁶ acenturion in the triarii.'’

foedus icisse: “made a treaty.” Notice the expression, lit. =
“to strike a treaty ’' (ep. percutere, ferire foedus). The phrase pro-
bably arose from the striking or slay’ing of an animal at the con-
clusion of a treaty. So, in Hebrew, the phrase is “to cut a
covenant,’' from the idea of cutting a sacrifice.

juris periti z for the genit. jem-is governed by peritus, cp. ᾧ 30.

M. Lepido Q. Catulo : in mentioning the names of Consuls the et is

“friendship ''; (4) “posterity,'’ “future ages ”—e.q., de me nulla
obmutescet vetustas, “future ages will never be silent about me‚’'
because in future ages the present age will be looked upon as vetustas,
that is to say, the interval between that future time and the present
will be called vetustas ,· hence Cicero calls the same period between now
and the future time vetas-tas, i.e.‚ ‘⁶ future ages.''

There must have been other provisions in the treaty. Cicero means
that nothing else could possibly be regarded as material to the question

with all religious solemnities.”

id: the words pico et aeterna pax.
