· 8 Μ. Τ. CICERONIS

and rank, I do not understand why jealousy should seem
more likely to dishonour the virtues of L. Cornelius than your
justice to sustain his honour. 19. And so that which should
be chiefly asked for I do not ask from you, judges, for this
reason, that Ι may not seem to have any doubt regarding
your wisdom and your kindly feeling. Still Ι ought to beg
you not to dislike ability, not to show yourselves hostile to
industry, not to think that culture should be orushed or
virtue punished. This only I do request, that if you see his
case to be strong and stable in itself, you will prefer that the
distinctions of the man himself should aid his case rather
than be a disadvantagze to it.

VIII. The case of Cornelius, O judges, has its origin in
that law which Lucius Gellius and Cn. Cornelius brought
forward in accordance with the will of the senate3 from which

statement could have been made than this, tnat federate
peoples must be ratifiers of the treaties'.l For such a right
belongs no more to federate than to all free peoples. But this
whole practice, judges, depended always on this considera-
tion and opinion, that when the Roman people had decreed
anything, if the allied peoples and the Latius adopted this
decree, and isthac same law which we ourselves observed
had settled in any people as it were on solid ground, that then
that people should be bound by that law :⁷ not that in any
respect our legal system should suffer, but that those peoples
should enjoy either that legal principle which had been
established by us, or some other advantage or benefit. 21. In
the time of our ancestors C. Furius brought in a law to deal
