maintain our diguity, which would certainly be lessened if it
were not perinitted to us to make use of the aid of their
citizens iu war. or if we had no power of bestowing rewards
upon them. 39. But as it is, what can I say against the
Gaditani when the cause which I plead is sauctioned by their
goodwill, by their decision, even by an embassy from them?
Men who have turned away'their hear-ts from the founders of
their mee, from their zeal for that state—ay, from all interest
in, and fellow-seeling sor, the Puni—to our empire and name 3
who, when mighty war-s were being waged against us, shut
out from their city those hy whom they were being waged,
pursued them with their fleets, repelled them by their personal
efforts, with their wealth, with their resources3 who con-

this right to be established, that for themselves and their
children, should any show conspicuous worth, there should
be a place in our camp, in the tents of our generals—in short,
with our standards and in our army, and that by these steps
they should even be able to rise to the citizenship.

XVIII. 41. But if it is permitted to the Africam, to the
Sardinians, to the Hispani, though mulcted in land and
tribute, to obtain our citizenship by approved excellence,
while this same privilege shall not be extended to the
Gaditani, though they are united to us by their services, by
prescriptive right, by their loyalty, by the dangers they have
incurred for us, by treaty, they will think not that they have
a treaty with ηε, but that most uujust laws have been iin-
