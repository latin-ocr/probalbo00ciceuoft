PRO L. C. BALBO ORATIO. 21

each colony Roman citizens, this favour should not be eon-
firmed when the right of giving it was withdrawn. 49. This
charge of yours has no resemblance to that one 5 but still, so
great was the personal influence of C. Marius, that he de-
fended and won that case, not by L. Crassus, his relation, a.
man of incredible eloquence, but himself, with a few words ;
so much importance was attached to his opinion. For who
could there be, judges‚ to wish that the right of singling out
those of highest worth should be taken away from our
generals, in the field or in battle, when commanding the
army; that the hope of reward should be taken away from
our allies and those united to us by treaty in defending
our republic'l But if the face of C. Marius, his voice, the
imperious tire of his look, his recent triumphs, his mien as
he stood before them then prevailed, let the authority, let

this be the distinction between citizens who are popular and
those who are brave, that the former shall enjoy their power
in their lifetime, but that the authority of the latter shall be
imperishable even when they are dead, if any defendet of
this empire can die.

is still alive, a Roman knight now, and a most excellent
citizen? Did not C. Marius confer it on two whole cohorts
of the Camertes? Did not P. Crassus, a most distinguished
man, confer it on Alexa of Heraclea, a citizen of a state with

, which an almost unique treaty is thought to have been con-
cluded in the times of Pyrrhus, when C. Fabricius was
consul? Didnot L. Sulla confer it on Aristo of Massilia?
Nay, since we are talking of the Gaditani, did he not also
confer it on nine Gaditanian householdersZ Did not Q.
Metellus Pius‚ a most just man, a man characterized by the
greatest conscientiousness and propriety of conduct, confer it
on Q. Fabius, a Saguntina? Did not he who is now here
present, M. Crassus, a man not only pre-eminent in influence
and wisdom, but also even too span-ing in hestowing the
citizenship, by whom all these matters-011 which Ι aiu now
