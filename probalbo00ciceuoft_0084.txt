Illyricum, finally subdued by Augustus. ἱ

Insubres (ᾧ 32).—A Gallie people who crossed the Alps and settled
in GaIlia Transpadana (c'.e.‚ on the northern or farther side of the Po,

before the Second Punic War. The last time they took up arms
against the Romans was at the battle of Comum, 197 nc. .

L.

Laenas (ᾧ 28).—Of G. Popilius Laenas little is known for certain.
Probably he was the legate in an army which disgracefully surrendered
to the Gauls : he had to go into exile because of a charge of majestas .
impending against him, 107 B.c. Probably the O. is a misprint, and
the person alluded to in ζ) 28 is P. Popilius Laenas, the father of
Gaius, who was consui in 132, and acted with great cruelty in prose-
cuting the accomplices of Tib. Gracchus. C. Gracchus in 123 passed
a measure against those magistrates who had condemneda citizen
without trial, and Laenas was obliged to withdraw from Rome by
‘⁴ voluntary ’⁹ exile.

Latium (ᾧ 31).-—-Strictly the district of Italy bounded by the Tiber
on the north, the Tuscan Sea on the west, the Liris on the south, and

any citizen of a Latin town 01· colony to emigrate to Rome and be
enrolled in one of the Roman tribes, (1) if he had held a magistracy in
his native town, or (2) if he had left a representative of his family in
that town. In ᾧ 31 Latium is not used in the strict geographical
sense, but comprises all those places which had jzcs Latii.

Lepidus (ξ 34).—M. Aemilius Lepidus was consul in B.c. 78,
together with Quintus Lutatius Catulus. He proposed, but unsuc-
cessfully, several laws with the object of destroying the constitution
of Sulla. The province of Further Gaul was allotted to him after his
consulship, but in 77 B.e. he was declared a public enemy: he there-
upon marched his army against Rome, but was defeated by Pompey
and Catulus.
