to you?

V. 11. W'hcn a boy I heard this story from my father :v—
When Ω. Metellus the son of Lucius, was defeuding himself
against a charge of extortion, that illustrioris man, to whom
the safety of his country was dearer than the sight of it, who
preferred leaving the state to giving up his opinions—when
this man, I say, was on his defence, and his books were
carried round for the items to be inspectori, there was no
judge among those Roman knights—all most influenti-al men
—-who did not avoid looking at them, and turn away corn-
pletely from them, lest any of them might chance to appear to
have had any doubt about the truth or falsity of his entries

and treaties 2 13. Is it your contention that he violated the·
treaty knowingly, or that he did so unconsciously'l If you
contend that he did so knowingly, alas for the glory of our
empire! Alas for the surpassing grandeur of the Roman
people! ›Al-as for the fame of Cn. Pompeius diffused so sar
and wide, that the home of his glory is bounded only by the
limits of our national empire l Aias for the nations, the cities,
the peoples‚ the kings, the tetrarclm, the despots‚ who have
been witnesses not only of Cn. Pompeius' valour in war, but
also of his conscientiousness in times of peace 1 Lastly‚ I call
upon you, voiceless regions and lands at the end of the world
—on you, Ο scas, harbours, ishznds, and coasts! For what
