sorus. :39

imperatorius ardor oculorum: “the bright flashing glauce of a
general.'' We are reminded of the story of the slave who was seut
to murder Marius when in prison. After the slave had entered the
cell he perceived through the gloom the bright eyes of Marius, who
said, ·‘ Slave. darest thou slay C. Marius Ρ ” Marius' look and words
took away what little courage was left in the slave, who thereupon
departed without fulfilling his orders.

discrimen: “ distinction'’ (the primary meaning). This word
also means (2) “interval‚” “distance‚'‘ (3) “decision‚” “turning
point,” (4) “danger.’'

gratiosos: “ full of influence‚” “ popular.’'

quisquam τ qaisquam may only be used in negative and comparative
sentences, and interrog. sentences expecting the answer no. Here the
conditional sentence is virtually equivalent to a negative statement
-“ no defender of this empire can die,'' and quisquam. is allowable.

immortalis: the position of this word shows that it is emphatic,
and must be taken as a predicate.

Cap. XXII„ § 50. Italico hello: the Social War, 90-88 uc.

C. Fabricio consule: Fabricius was consul in 282 and 278; his
first consulship is alluded to. Notice this phrase is a kind of abl.
absolute; it cannot be the abl. of the agent after ictum, for this would
require a preposition ab.

eros novem : this reading is probably corrupt, and the emendation
of Reid, “ser-cos novem‚’' is very neat and satisfactory. Erus=“a
lord‚’' “ master‚'' “ landed proprietor.'’ Some texts give idem heros =
“ the same hero‚'' i.e.‚ Sulla.

ΟΞΠ. Crassus: counsel for the defence‚ together with Pompey and
cero.

Avennensem: v.l. Aveniensem.
§ 51. conaris: followed by the infin. infirmare.

“ With ask, command, advise, and strive,
By at translate infinitive,
But not so aster jubeo nor
After verb deponent eoram-2⁹

patrem suum: Cn. Pompeius Strabo, Consul, 13.c. 89.

in uno Cornelio . . . Ovios . . . Fabios: enfranchised slaves generally
adopted the praenomen and nomen qentilicium of their former masters.
Thus the enfranchised slave of M. Tullius Cicero was M. Tullius Tiro.
To the praenomen and nomen was added generally the name he had
borne as a slave. The names in the text show that the members of
Cornelian, Ovian, and Fabian qentes were concerned in bringing
about the respective enfranchisements. Instead of Ovios and fabios,
there is another reading, obvios and fabros.
