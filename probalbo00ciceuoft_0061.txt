divine sanction.'’ WVhen the sanctiones of the law are sacratae the
law is sacrosanct, and a law is saer-osane! when the penalty is inflicted
by the gods, whether by the gods alone or by gods and man.

genere ipso : eff„ “ a truce '' ; the penalty of breaking a truce is
necessarily inflicted by the gods, because men (i.e.‚ the weaker party)
may not have the power.

obtestatione et consecratione: obtestatio = “calling the gods to
witness the law,” and punish its violation; consec-ratio = “execra-
tion‚’' devoting the offender to human punishment. The whole of
this passage is corrupt. Reid reads, “ Sanc-tiones sacrandae sunt aut
genere ipso poenae aut eum obtestatione et consecratione legis, caput
ejus, qui contra fecerit, consecratur. With this reading there is a
change of construction from the abl. qenere ipso poenae to eum eonse-
cratm. With our reading, obtestatione is exactly parallel with yenere,
and iz the abl. of instr. after sacrandam with Reid's reading,
obtestatione is the abl. of instr. after consecratur.

ejus modi goes with quid. Notice iqitur is third word in the sen-
ἓθὲἰί, though generally it is second; εο, a little further on, de quibus
q confirmas? “do you assert ἓ ”

reciperemus: from recipio, “to reeeive‚’' not from recipero or
recupero, ‘⁶ to recover.’'

tamen id esset : the constructionis, “tamen ratum esset (pluperf.)
id quod postea populus jussisset.”

dg> iis refers back to de quibus etiam at the beginning of the
sen nce.

nixa duabus Hispaniis: “supported by the two Spains,” ele„
Hither and Further Spain, Hispania Citerior and Ulterior. The
river Iberus separated Hispania Citerior or Tarraconensis from
Hispania Ulterior (Lusitania and Baetica). A distinction sometimes
drawn between nisus and nixus, both participles of 721' tor, is-msns =
“ struggling,'' “striving, by means of something '’ 3 nitus =
“ relying on‚'’ “ supported by something.''

duo fulmina: Lucretius and Vergil call the two great Scipios
(Africanus Major and Africanus Minor) “ thunderbolts of war,'' and
Cicero may be imitating their words. Reid reads Iumina.
