INTRODL‘CTION. 9

privileges of Roman citizens induced the Italian nations
to take up arms in 91 B.C., and from that date arose the
practice of a commander's bestowing the franchise upon
specially deserving allies on the battlefield. The privilege,
really issegal, was rarely used: and, when Pompey wished
to bestow the civitas upon Balbus, 116 obtained permission
to do so by the Lex Gellia Cornelia (72 κα). So far the
enfranchisement of Balbus was perfectly legal.

But the prosecutor—we do not know who he was—
argued that the town of Gades was a civitas foederata, or a
state under definite treaty with Rome. Therefore no
legislation of Rome which touched a citizen of Gades was
valid unless the Gaditani had passed a law to the like
effect. But, though this argument was perfectly truc of
legislation affecting the whole state of Gades it did not
apply to any particular and isolated case. Some t1 eaties
contained a special proviso that no citizen of the alien
state should be admitted to the Roman aevitas and it
was not unusual foi a whole community, when offered that
σ’ἰυίὐαε, to decline it. Neither of these points applied to
the case of the Gaditani, who, on the contrary, were eager
in their support of Balbus, who was their patronus (ξ 41), or
representative, in Rome. Finally, if it were argued that
the Lesa Gellia Cornelia could not override the terms
of the original treaty (foedus) with Gades, Cicero answers
that that treaty was not formal, but only informally
rat-ified (ξ 33), and therefore of less authority than a
special and formal plebiscitum such as the Lea: Gellia.

after Pompey’s speech of the previous day. ξ 5. Pompey's

Nor did 116 do so unwittingly,! for he is peculiarly well
