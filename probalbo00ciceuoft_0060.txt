Cap. X IV„ ᾧ 32. Etenim : there is another reading cet enim which
is the common conj unction to begin an answer to an opponent.

ubi non sit: the subjunct. expresses a supposition, indefinite-
ness. There is another reading est which brings out the notion of a

fact.

sicubi: “ if anywhere‚’⁷ from si and (e)2cbi; this word shows that
qugts'z' ubi3 ugzle, δῖα, originally began with c or qq, like oum (quum),
, , quw, .

definite: (“ definitely'⁷), “in express terms.’'

potestatem: the difference between potestas and potentia is that
potes-tas = “ legal, official authority‚'’ polemia- ε “ the power derived
from wealth‚⁷’ Sco„ or often ‘⁴ illegal power,” ‘⁴ undue influence‚''
like that of a despot.

siquidem sacrosanctum est: “ since indeed it is inviolable,
sacrosanct.” With the reading of our text, these words are the
argument of the prosecutor. There is another reading s1 QUID
sAcizosAxcrnM EST, these words being a quotation by the prosecutor
of the terms of the law, the same that we have at the end of § 33.

Poenorum jura: Gades was on'ginally a colony of the Phoenicians,
so Poenorum = Gaditanormn.

calles: calleo, -e‘›·e‚-in prose writers is generally intransitive; it is

frequently transitive in poets, but rarely so in Cicero. Here it is
transitive and governs jnra. The primary meaning of calleo = “ to

be hard‚” hence “to be hardened by practice,'’ “to have had ex-x

perience‚'’ “ to be skilfulst’
potuisti inspicere: see note, ᾗ 20, on potuit diei.

judicio publico: the prosecutor had been convicted in a criminal
trial, and had consequently been deprived of his civil rights, and so
could not make inquiries about the laws.

ᾧ 33. rogatio: roqatio z an inquiry of the people as to whether
they will decree this or that, ‘⁴ a proposed law ’³ ; it was called a lem
after it w'as passed. Here, however, it is incorrectly used for lex.

populus: the whole people, plebeians and patricians, who met in
the comitia centuriata.

plebesve: the plebeians alone, who met in the concilium plebis.

sanxit : ‘⁴ ratified.” Sanctio z ‘⁴ ratification,‘' “ a decreeing as in-
violable‚’' hence it came to mean ‘⁴ a penalty '³ ; so in ordinary
English thde sanetiom of a law = the penalties by which that law can
be enforce . -

sacrandae sunt : sacro = “ to render sacred or inviolable” ; sacrata
lea· = “ a law whose violation was punished by devoting the criminal
to the infernal gods '⁹ : so here sanctiones sacrandae sum = ‘⁴ the
penalties (or penal clauses) must be rendered indolable‚’ ’ ‘ ‘placed under

mite -·-,„. -
