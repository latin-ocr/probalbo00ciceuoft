Pno L. c. BALBO ORATIO. 3

when a most stubborn contest was going on, he served both
in the fleet and in the army, with Q Metellus, with C.
Memmius; that he never left Memmius from the time when
Pompeius came to Spain, and first had Memmius as his
quaestor3 that he was besieged in Carthagena3 that he was
engaged in those desperate and important battles fought on
the Sucro and Turia3 that he did not leave Pompey till the
very end of the war. 6. These are the virtues of Cornelius:
affection for our state, hard work and diligence‚ a fighting
spirit, and a valour worthy of his noble general, and ambition
to win rewards proportioned to his perils.

ΙΙΙ. For all these reasons he was presented with the
>citizenship by Cn. Pompeius. This the accuser does not
deny, but he finds fault with it, so that, in the case cf
Cornelius, his pleas meet with approval, yet punishment is
demanded3 in the case of Pompeius, his pleas are slighted‚
but there is no penalty except that his reputation may suffer.
Thus they wish the fortunes of a man entirely innocent, and
the act of a general of the highest distinction, to be condemned
together. Therefore the civil rights of Cornelius, the act of
Pompey, are now challenged in the eom-ts. You admit that
this man was born in a most honourable position in his native
state, and that from his earliest years, leaving all his own
affairs, he was engaged in our wars under our generals, and
that there is no toil, no siege, no battle, in which he has not
taken a part. All this is not only most meritorious‚ but
belongs peculiarly to Cornelius, and in this exists no ground
of accusation. 7. Of what, then, is he accused'? Because
Pompey presented him with the citizenship. Is this a charge
that can be brought against my client2 By no means, unle÷s
an honour is to be considered a disgrace. Against whom,
then, can it be brought 2 As a matter of fact, against no one3
and so far as concerns the contention of the accuser, against
him alone who made the gift3 and if he, intluenced by kindly
feeling, had conferred this honour on a less suitable person—
nay, even if he had conferred it on a good man, but one who
did not deserve such an honour—if, in short, something were
alleged to have been done, not uulawful indeed, but unseeinly,
neverthekss, gentlemen, all such censure as this should he
rejected by you. 8. But, as the case stands, what is said}
