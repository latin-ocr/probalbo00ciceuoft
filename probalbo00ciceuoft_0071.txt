in columna ahenea : there has always been a dispute among scholars
with reference to this monument, its situation and the inscription
it was supposed to contain. The ancient Romans used to write their
laws and treaties on brazen monuments, and place them in the Forum,
in which stood the rostra.

rostra : rostra is the pl. of rostrum, “ a beak of a bird,’' or “ prow
of a vessel.'' The rostra was a stage or platform for speakers in the
forum, so called from being adorned with the beaks of ships taken from
the Cnthaginians, 260 Bc ; hence it came to mean the “ platform ''
or “ pulpit '’ of any orator. According to one authority the brazen
pillar was not near the rostra, but in the temple of Diana.
