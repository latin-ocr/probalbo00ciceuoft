conferred on their citizens for their valiant services. For we
should no more be able to employ these men as our helpers
if we were to refuse to them the rewards of valour, than if it
were altogether unlawful that they should be employed 111 our
warS. For inasmuch as, since nian's creation‚ but few have
been found who, with no hope of reward held out to them,
have exposed their lives to the weapons of the eneiny on beli-alf
of their own country, do you think that one will be found to
expose himself to danger on behalt' of a foreign state, when

fied treaties with us showed a marvellous lack of knowledge
——since this right extends to all ,free peoples‚ and is not con-

can, by the law of the state, be a citizen of two states ε the
man cannot belong to this state who has forinally declared

as Q. Maximus, C. Laenas, Q. Philippus at Neucmia, C.
Cato at Tarraco, Q. CaepiO, P. Rutilius at Smyrna—that
