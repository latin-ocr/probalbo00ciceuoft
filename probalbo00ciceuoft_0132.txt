6 M. T. cronnoms

not still exist the imprints both of the bravery and, in truth,
of the kindliness of this man, of his resolution and of his
prudence‘l Will anyone dare to say that this man, endowed
with almost incredible and unprecedented influence, virtue,
and firmness, knowingly disregarded, violated, and broke
treaties ’ἒ

VI. 14. The accuser hy his gesture cedes this point to me—
he means that Pompey dial it unwittingly. As if, indeed, it
is not a lighter matter, when one is engaged in such im-

greatest moment, to do something which one knows to be
unlawful, than not to know at all what is lawful. For
whether was the man who had carried on in Spain a very

fully stated, Ι will say more, because of the vices of the age
rather than because of the nature of the trial. For this is, so
to speak, the stain and blemish of this age, to bear a grudge
against virtue, to wish to bruise the very flower of diguitv.
16. For if Pompeius had lived five hundred years ago 3 it· tl is
man, from whom, while yet a mere youth and a Roman
knight, the senate had frequently sought aid for the common
