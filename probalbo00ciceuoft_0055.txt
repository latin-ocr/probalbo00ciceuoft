Norss. 45

large number of slaves in order to raise an army in opposition to
Sulla, 88 ss.c.‚ and slaves were often enfranchjsed by the will of their
master at his death.

meritos: the active form mereo is used as well as the deponent
mereor. Here meritos = “desewing‚'’ from the deponent, but it also
means “ deserved,’' “ just‚'’ ⁴⁴ proper.”

Cap. X.‚ 25. patrone: here patronus has the meaning of “ protector,”
“patron,’' rather than of “ advocate.'' It was the custom of allied
states to choose some well-known person at Rome to represent their
interests whenever a question arose about them3 thus one of the Fabii
(Q. Fabius Sanga) was the patron of the Allobrogian Gauls. The
prosecutor is here sarcastically called “ the patron of treaties.''

tuis civibus : ‘⁴ your fellow citizens.” The prosecutor was a native
of Gades as well as the defendant Balbus.

ut quod iis: ut goes with ne liceat ipsis at the end of the sentence.
The order is, “ut ne liceat ipsis, ut ab senatu et ab imperatoribus
nostris civitate donentur, id quod, si populus Romanus permiserit,
liceat iis quos armis subegimus, adjuti a majoribus tm’s magnis opi-
bus, atque m dicionem nostram subegimus) ’‘— ‘That they themselves
should not be allowed to be presented with the citizenship by our
senate’ s generals, a thing which, with the permission of the Roman
people, those men are allowed, whom we, helped with great forces by
your ancestors, subdued by force of arms and reduced beneath our
swa .”

Tliere is another reading, quos Magmi armis adjutoribus tuis sube-
qimus, = “ whom we oonquered by the arms of Magnus, your fellow-
citizens helping us.” With this reading, illaqueas = Pompey, who,
on his return from Spain in 81, was diguified with the name of Maqnus
by Sylla; adjutoribus tuis is a kind of ablative absolute, tuis being
put for tuis civibus, = “your (the prosecutor's) fellow-citizens.'’ Halm
reads maqnis adjutoribus illis usi.

ne quis ε “ that no one ” ; after ne, nisi, num, and si you must use
quis. not aliquis, for the indefinite pronoun.

capitis Vitae : object. genitive 3 cp. dimicatio eapitis in ᾧ 23.

dimicaret: this is the end of the protasis or ‘⁴ {f'' clause. The
apodosis begins with qma-iter.

jure: “rightly,” not “by law.'’ Jus is used in a great many
nenses—(1) ‘⁴ justice‚” (2) “a court of justice,'' (3) “legal rights in
general,’' (4) “ a special right.’'

auxilia: auxilia here may possibly mean “ help‚'’ “resources,”
“ reserves‚'’ but it is generally used (as in auxiliis above) in the special
sense of ‘⁴ auxiliaries,'' mostly composed of contingente from the allies
and light-armed troops.

alienigenarum: from alieniqena, a noun in apposition to homimem,
