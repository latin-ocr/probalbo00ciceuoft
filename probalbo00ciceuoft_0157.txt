'l'he Tutorial Series consists of Text-Books and Guides specially
written to meet. the requirements of the various London University
Exuminutions by Tutors of Umvnnsnw Commspoxnexca COLLEGE.

All Latin and Greek Classica prescribed for Lomlm. University are
translated in the Tutor-tal Series, and also edited if no thoroughly
euitable commentat-y has already been issued. Vocabularies in order
of the Text are prepared for Matriculation and Intermediate Arts.

The expense involved in pu1·chasi11g‚forthe study of short periods

specially written for the purposes of the Examination. Such works
are provided in the Tutorial Series for each Intermediate Arts
Examination, and also for B.A. whenever there is a distinct want.
