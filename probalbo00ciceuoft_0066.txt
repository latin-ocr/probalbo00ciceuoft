56 CICERO PRO BALBO.

laudatores ζ the technical word for witnesses to character, who would
naturally praisc up the party on whose behalf they are called.

hujus periculi : periculi is obj. gen. of deprecatores, and. hujus
probably = “ of him'' or “ his ” (Balbus')‚ and depends on periculi.
It could, however, be the genit. agreeing with periculi.

re denique multo : the reading inthe text is corrupt, and cannot be
readily translated3 inaudita must be taken, not as = “ unheard,’' but
as from inuadit), which scarcely differs in meaning from audio. Huic
= Balbo, illo and istum refer to the prosecutor, who was also a citizen
of Gades. Reid reads, “ re denique multo ante Gadibus audita, ne
forte huic ab illo periculum crearetur, gravissima in istum civem suum
Gaditani in senatu convicia fecerunt.’' Convicia = “ abuse.’'

ξ 42. magis : the distinction between maqis and potius is that maqis,
strictly a compar. of maqnus, “ great ” (major, majus = moqior,
Μαρέης, or Μηρὸς) = “ more,’' “ greater,” while potius (from potis =
“able ¹¹) z .“ more able,'’ “better.'’

magnopere: “greatly‚’' for mayuo opere (the reading of Reid),
= “ with great work.'’

scita ac :Iussa : scita, from δσὶεσο, “ to adopt,'’ has special reference
to the plebiscita, or resolutions of the plebs as passed in the Comitia
Tributa. J ussa = “ commands‚'’ generally.

mutatum: ‘⁴ changed from,'' vhe„ deprived of the citizenship.

judicium voluntatis :judicium = “ judgment,” is abetter reading
than indicium = “ sign,'' “ token.”

multa ζ “ punishment‚'' the same word as in multatis, § 41.
civis . . . testis: acc. pL, = cives, testes.

,ἱ 43. quin sentiat: see G„ ᾧ 461.

Gaditanis: dat. of agent after retinendmn; see Gn, ᾗ 294.

in perpetuum : Reid reads perpetuo, and omits the in.

civitatis: descriptive genit., Roby'e Gr„ §§ 1302-13063 cp.§ 10,
amplissimae diqm'tatzis ,· not the same as gen. of quality, G„ ᾦ 274.

quis est enimnostrum: for the partitive genit. nostrum, see G„
ᾧ 269, and also note on nostrum, ᾧ 18.

Cap. XIX. cum esset praetor: Caesar was propraetor in Hispania
Ulterior in 61 B.c., and Balbus was his praefectus fabrum.

controversias sedarit : we must either supply quantas, fromquantis,
or else (and preferably) supply ut = “ how‚'' which can go with the
rest of the verbs in the sentence. The controversias, according to
Plutarch, were troubles and disputes between creditor and debtor.

disciplina z ‘⁶' teachings, ’ ’ “ institutions.' '
hujus: i.e., Balbus.
