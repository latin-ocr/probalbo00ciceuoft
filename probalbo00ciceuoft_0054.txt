44 CICERO PRO BALBO.

qui nostros duces : no doubt all these phrases have special reference
to events in Balbus' life, when he helped the Roman general by working
for him and obtaining supplieS, Sco.

commeatus : this word could be genitive, and taken as parallel with
laboris, an et being unexpressed; it is possible to take it as acc. pl.
after juverit = “ helped our s lies at his own persona] danger,''
ie, “helped us or our geneffivith supplieS.’' It might also be
taken as acc. of respect: “ helped our general in respect of supplies.'’

comminus : “ hand to hand,'' derived from eum, “ together,'' and
maanus, “ a hand.''

telis hostium : notice the rhetorical repetition of the same idea in
three forms—telis hostium, dimicationi capitis, morti.

capitis: object. gen„ “ fight for his head (or life).'’ The way to
tell whether a genit. depending on a noun is objective or subjective is
—Turn this noun into an active verb, and, if the meaning requires the
genit. to be the subject of the verb, it is a subj. gen„ and, if the
meaning requires the genit. to be the object of the verb, it is an obj.
gen. Thus Aeduorum injuriae = (1) ‘⁴ the injuries caused by the
Aedui,” (the Aedui injure), subj. gen. ; (2) “ the injuries done to the
Aedui‚'' (they injure the Aedui), obj. gen.

affici possit t the subjunct. depends on ut after ista, and corresponds
to eareat. chverz‘t, pnqnarit are in the subjunct. because they are in
dependent sentences depending on a subjunctive.

t} 24. velint: generic subjunct. G„ § 482.

de quibus agimus: “about whom we are speaking'’ (lit,
“ dealing‚” “ acting''), ‘⁴ about whom the question is at present.'’

exclusos : claudo, .“ to shut,” when compounded with a prepositi0n‚
has the (m changed to u, e.g., excludo, includo, concludo, &Q

quae pateant: quae refers to z'z's praemiis et iis honoribus.

stipendiariis : the stipendiarii were those tributaries who had to pay
their taxes in money, the most humiliating form of taxation. The
veetiyales, or those who had to pay tribute in kind (i.e., in corn, cattle,
δια), were in a more respected position.

magno usui: the predic. dat. confused by Smith (see G. ᾗ 297)
with the dat. of purpose.

servos : it was nothing unusual in Rome to give slaves their freedom
and make them citizens, but it was unusual to make a high-born, in-
fluentia] citizen of another state a Roman citizen. The result was
that the body of citizens was increased by a large number of former
slaves, who, in many caseS‚ retained the degrading sentiments engen-
dered by slavery: but they refused to admit men who, by their
intrinsic merits‚ would have been an ornament and honour to them.
Many slaves were made citizens who volunteerd to join the Roman
