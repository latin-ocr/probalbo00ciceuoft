NOTES. 35

cum plena . . . tum ι “ not only . . . but als0.’' Plena is sometimes

ἘῩΙὲῗΙἜΞᾰἯξέἱξξ, gen. and sometimes by an abl.; cp. “full of’‘ and

crimen: see note on ξ 2. Crimen here means “anything on which
to base an accusation ”; hence it approaches somewhat closely to the
meaning “ crime.’'

§ 7. hujus crimen: “is this a charge against my client? '⁹ The
stress is on hujus.

honos ignominia putanda est: the attraction of the verb into the
gender of the predicate is very common. Honos is, of course, the nom.
= honor; cp. arbos, floS.

actione: actio = (1) “ action’' or “ suit,'’ (2) “indictment'' or
“ accusation‚” (3) “ the management of the indictment.'' The
third meaning is the one employed here.

qui si : the relative qui must often, as here, be sph't up into a con-
junction, “ but,'’ “ and‚'’ “ when,’' &c.‚ and a dem. pron., ‘⁶ he‚'’
“ it,'' Sec.

minus idoneum: “ not fit '' ; ep. note on mimas referenda qratia,
ᾗ 2, 3150 s'in minus = “ but if not.''

quin etiam : “ nay more.'’ Quin is sor qui ne = “ by which not‚”
the qui being an old abl. of qui. Non dubium est quin veniat = “ there
is no doubt by which he may not come‚” i.e.‚ ‘⁴ there is no doubt that
he will come.” Quin also = “why not⁷’ ; quin etiam = “why not
also,” hence = ‘¹ nay more.”

aliquid: after ne, m‘sz', num, and si, qais is generally used instead
of aliquis. Here the form aliquid is kept so as to lay stress upon the
meaning some, and not any.

contra ac = “ otherwise than ’' ; the explanation of the construction
is, “ done otherwise, and it was allowable otherwise,'' ι’.ε., “ done
otherwise than was allowable.''

liceret . . . oporteret : licet = “itis allowable‚”as regards physical
possibility; oportet = “it is right or necessary‚’' regarded from 3
sense of duty or morality.

avobis repudianda: ablative of the agent with the preposition a
is used here to bring into prominence the idea of agency. Ordinarily
tlie gerundive in -dzcs is followed by the dat.; e.g.‚ omnibus esc
moriendum = ‘⁶ all must die.’'

ᾧ 8. nunc vero: “ but as it is,” ‘⁴ but in the present case.’'
licuerit: subjunct.‚ dependent sentence in Or. Obliqua.

Cap. IV. cuncter? =“am I to hesitate?’' The words sic affere
down to fateamur are not found in all editions.

§9. ususne rerum: “experience.” Notice the addition of the
concrete word rerum, where‘in English the abstract noun is sufficient 2
