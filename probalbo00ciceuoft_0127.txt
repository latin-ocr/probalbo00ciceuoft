Ι. 1. IF in trials the prestige of the advocates is of any evall,
the cause of L. Cornelius has been defended by most honour-
able—if experieuce‚ by most skilful-—if ability, by most
eloquent—if affection, by most friendly ones; and by men
bound to L. Cornelius both by many kindly actions and the
closest intimacy. What part can I, then, playCl One of so
much authority as you have chosen to attribute to me 3 one of
moderate experience, and of ability by no means on a par with
my good-will. For Ι see that this man is very deeply indebted
to all the others by whom he has been defended 5 how deeply
Ι am indebted to him Ι will tell you at another time. 2. At
the outset of my speech Ι say this, that if Ι have been able
but poorly to recompense all those who have befriended my
safety and my honour, by conferring favours in my '‘curn, Ι will
assuredly requite them by declaring and acknowledgiug their
favours. ln his speech of yesterday, gentlemen of the jury,
how great was the power of Cn. Pompeius, how great his Α
ability3 how great his eloquence, seemed to be acknowledged
not by your tacit approval, but by your ope‘nly-expressed ad—
miration. For I have never heard any speech delivered which
seemed to me to show a nicer knowledge of the law, a
greater memory for precedente, a more intimate acquaintance
with treaties‚ a more brilliant judgment regar-(ling ware, a
more impressive opinion on public affairs, a more medear.
