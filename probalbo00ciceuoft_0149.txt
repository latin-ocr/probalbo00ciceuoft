PRO L. C. BALBO ORATIO. 23

been taken up as a state question. Many men have been
admitted to the citizenship who have been released from free
and federate peopkzs, but no one has ever been arraigned on
the ground of his exercising civil rightS, either because his
nation had not sormally ratified their treaty, or because by the
treaty his right os changing his state was barred. 53. Ι will
even dare to assert this, that no one was ever condemned who
was known to have been presented with the citizenship by a
general of ours. Now learn the judgment of the Roman
people declared on many occasions, and established by fact
and custom in cases of the greatest importance. who does

is, to federate peoples, by that very stringent law of Servilius-
and this right was not disputed by the Licinian and Mucian
law, especially when the very nature ot' the accusation, and
