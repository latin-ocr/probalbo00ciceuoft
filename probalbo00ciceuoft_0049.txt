Norae. 39

was for eqo quidem and could only be used with the first person singu-
lar. It has nothing to do with eqo, but is compounded of the iuterj. e or

ec and quidem, and cau be used with the lst or 3rd persons sing. or pl.,
and with the 2nd sing.

contra: adv., = “ on the other hand.'’
illarum quae: e.q., oratory and philosophy.
laudem : laus means “ merit,’‘ as wcll as “ praise.''

scientiam in foederibus: this is a very unusual construction; we
should have expected either fhederum, or else a gerund, eg.. interpre-
tandi-x. The addition of the adjective praestabilem helps to smooth the
construction, since we could have an in after an adj. like praestabi-
lem instead of the simple ablative, e.g., praestabilis in virtute instead
of praestabilis virtute.

condicionibus : condicio = “ an agreement ” or “ terms of an agree-
ment.'’ According to Reid the difference between foedus and pactio
is that foedus is a solemn ‘⁶ treaty,'’ concluded by the fetiales with reli-
gious formalities ; pacato is a simple “ agreement ” between two
generals, without any authorisation from Rome. Such an agreement
would be valid as regards a temporary matter, but invalid, unless
ratified, as regards a permanent settlement.

in umbra atque otio: umbra, “shade‚” is often used of a life of
retiffmenm thus vita umbratilis is opposed to a practical life of
exe ion.

litterae: littera in the sing. = “a letter of the alphabet‚” in the
pl. it = (l) “a letter'’ or “epistle,” (2) “literature‚'' “ history,''
“ the sciences.'’ The second meaning is employed here, and the word
litterae corresponds to libri.

causa? dicta est: “ my case for the defence is finished.’'
vitiis . . . genere: abl. of the cause; see G„ ξ 311.

ξ 16. abhinc annos quingentos: “ 500 years ago,’' ι’,ε., 500 years
before 56 13.c. The acc. os duration is strange, because here there is
no idea of duration, unless we look at the sentence in this way, ‘⁶ going
back during a space of 500 years before the present time, if Pompey
had then lived.'’ Abhinc is generally found with the acc.

adulescentulo : Pompey was born in 106 Bc, and in 84 he marched
to the assistance of Sulla, the leader of the senatorial party, on his
return to Italy. He distinguished himself in the war against the
Marians, especially in Africa, and in 81, when he was only 25 years
old, he entered Rome, being honoured with a triumph for his victory
over the Moor Iarbas. The triumph was granted to him, although
he was a simple eques and held no office. The -eclus is a diminutive
termination3 cp. librarioltcs.

omnis = omnes, the pl. Be on the look-out for this method of
spelling, which is probably the more correct ; so also the gcnitives in -ὶ
and -ii ,· the use of a p instead of a b before an δ· or t.‚, eg, opsessio,
optre‘ctatio, for the ordinary obsessio, obtrectatio.
