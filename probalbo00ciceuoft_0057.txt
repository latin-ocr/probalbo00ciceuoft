and evenio of indifferent fortune, when it does not matter one way or
the other (cp. “event ’').

hoc solum : solum = ·‘ scil,'' i.e.‚ ‘⁸ change their home and abode.”

sed etiam postliminio corresponds to “ neque solum dicatione
post liminium'’ ; lit. means “ a return behind one’s threshold,' ' r'.e., ·‘ a
return to one's old home and conditions,” esp. of a Roman citizen
after banishment‚ or aster being made a slave through capture by an

enemy,—“ the right to return home and resume one’s former privi-
leges and rank.”

libertino: libertinus = a freedman,¹ in reference to his status in

society or in the state3 he was called libertus with respect to his

legati nostri: after a new province was conquered, the Romans
used to send a commission (leqati), consisting generally of ten senators,
to settle the affairs of the government of the province. This hap-
pened in Greece in 167 B.c., after the end of the Third Macedonian
War, and again after the capture of Corinth, 146 13.c.

latum est: impersonal = “ a proposal was brought before the
people.''

Si domum revenisset: the pluperf. subjunct. in the oblique narra-
tion here stands for the fut. perf. indic. in Or. Recta. The difficulty
was that Publicius had been a citizen of his native state, had then
been taken prisoner in war, and from being a slave at Rome had been
enfranchised. Now, if he went back to his native land, by the right
of “postliminium ’' he would become again a citizen of his city, and
consequently of necessity cease to be a citizen of Rome, for a man
could not be a. citizen of Rome and also a citizen of another city.

Cap. XII„ ᾧ 29. Quod si = “but if” ; quod is probably the acc. of
respect = “as to which if,’' hence ‘⁶ but if'' ; so inDeAmicitia, §90‚
quod eontra = “ whereas on the other hand.”

Gaditanum: the verb esse takes the same case after it as before it,
so we should expect Gaditano to agree in case with cici. The acc.
can bc explained as follows:-— (l) Errare est humanum, Hominem
errare esc humanum = ‘⁴ To err is human‚’' (2) “ that aman should err
is human.” From instance (2) we see then an acc. with the infin.
Hominem errare can be the subject of a verb (esc) ; so here (hominem)

esse Gaditanam, that a man should be a Gaditane, is the subject of licet,
and civi Romano is the indirect object.

sive exilio: there were three ways by which a Roman citizen
could become a citizen of Gades :—(1) by having been a citizen of
Gades before being a citizen of Rome, and losing his citizenship at
Rome through going into exile to avoid punishment ; (2) postliminio,
i.e., by having been a citizen of Gades before being a citizen of Rome,
