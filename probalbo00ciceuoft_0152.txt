mony and prayers of these, I render in return the service
which he has so well deserved, and as I said at the begin-
ning, this gratitudo which is so justly his due, and Ι hope,
judges, that, as you love and hold dear those who were fore-
most in maintaining my safety and my honour, so what has

been done by this man, considering his powers and his posi- ’

tion, has been pleasing, and has commended itself to you. He
will not then be hard pressed by his own enemies, but by
the enemies of his friends, who are numerous and powerfu13
whom, indeed, Cn. Pompeius, in his eloquent and weighty
speech yesterday, bade contend against himself if they
pleased3 but he called on them to abandon this unequal
struggle and unjust contest.

always thought to be characteristic of brave and great men,
and Ι have never been found wanting in regard to this task,
this duty, this office. But contending is only wise so long
as it serves some good purpose, or, if it does not serve, is not
hurtful to the state. 61. We desired certain things, we strove
for them, we tried to get them, but we failed to obtain
them. Some grieved in silence ; we exhibited our grief and
sorrow openly. Why should we choose rather to overthrow
than to nphold that which we cannot change? The senate
distinguished C. Caeaar with a most honourable form of thanks-
giving and one of an unprecedented number of days. And
though the public resources were then much straitened, they
bestowed pay on the victorious army, assigned ten lieutenants
to the general, and by the Sempronian law voted· that no
successor should be appointed to him. These votes I pro-
posed and supported, for Ι did not think that Ι should con-
