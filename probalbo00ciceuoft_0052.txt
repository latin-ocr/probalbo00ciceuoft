42 CICERO PRO BALBO.

poeniendam: this is another form of puniendam. For the inter· ’

{hange of dthe vowels oe and u, cp. moenia and nmmo, poena and punio,
oer'ms an Punicus.

adjumento . . . impedimento : predicative datives.
causae : is the genit. depending on adjumento.

Cap. VII! L. Gellius Cn. Cornelius: notice the omission of et, in
accordance with the usual rule.

satis esse sancti: if we take this reading, sancti must be partitive
genitive depending on satis, ⁴⁴ there is enough of ratification, '’ ‘⁴ it is
sufficiently ratified <or established).” Ita esse sanctum, an emendation
of Reid, is much more satisfactory, and was probablv the original
reading; the s of videmus may have been repeated, and a copyist not
understanding sita may have altered it to satis: πα esse sanctum— = “it
{as established 111 such a way that.'' or simply , ‘it was established
t at.'

ᾧ ldie consilii sententia : ⁴⁴ after consulting his advisers ’⁷ ; see supra,

foederato populo. Gades was a state allied to Rome by the fixed
teims of a treaty.

fundus: fzmdus primarily means the bottom of anything; hence, (1)
“the foundation,’ (2) “authority.” Fundus, “a farm‚'’ probably
comes from the same meaning of ⁴⁴ bottom,'’ through the successive
steps, (1) ‘⁴ foundation‚’' (2) ⁴⁴ soil‚'' hence (3) ‘⁴ farm.” The
meaning ⁴⁶ authority ’³ or ‘⁴ ratifierss’tis very rare, and only occurs in
a few passages.

civitatem : ‘⁴ citizenship,” i.e., could become a citizen.

ᾧ 20. interpretem ; interjectional accusative ; cp. me miserum. Ο
can be followed either by the voc.‚ as in ᾧ 13 : Ο nationes . . . tyranni,
or hythe interjectional accusative. So also pro J αφ, “Pro curia in·
versique mores‚’' = ⁴⁴ Alas for the senate and the perversion of morals,”
and ⁴⁴ Pro‚deum atque hominum fidem'' = “Alas for the saith of gods
and men.’

expertis: acc. pl. of expers, governing genit. praemiorwm.

potuit dici z ‘⁴ could have been said.’' Notice in Latin the perfect
of the auxilia1·y(potm', debui, oportuit) and the present of the main
verb where in English we use the present of the auxiliary and the
perfect with have of the main verb. We must also notice the indic. Δ
used graphically where we might expect the subjunctive expressing a
condition.

magis proprium: adjectives in -ius form their comparatives by
the use of mayis: see G., ᾧ 64, iv. Here, however, proprium being
followed by a genitive, and not by a dative, is probably a noun, and
mayis stands by itself as an adverb.
