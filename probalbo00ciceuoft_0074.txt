64 CICERO PRO BALBO.

in order of dignity according to the offic-es they had held, ‘'ff-⁵ censorii,
consulares, praetorii, aalilz‘ec’i, quaestorz‘i, ancl they were called upon to
speak in that order. The vote of a praetorius was called praetoria
sententia. By a successful prosecution an aedilicius could be raised to
the rank of an praetorius.

praetextam togam : “a toga bordered with purple,'’ worn at Rome
by the higher magistrates, and by free-born children until they
assumed the loqu virilis.

consecuntur : Cicero is fond of slightly varying his words, aq„ eon-
secantur as a variation of adsecutus.

Theophani : the Cioeronian genit. of Theophanes. This is a sub-
jective genitive = ‘⁴ adoption by Theophanes.’'

praeterquam propinquorum suorum hereditates: the meaning is
not clear. Perhaps Theophanes had married into the family of
Balbus, and Balbus, by being Theophanes' heir, only inherited the
property of his own relations. Perhaps we are supposed to under-
stand that the money received by Balbus through Theophanes
originally belonged to Balbus’ own family.

The prosecutor tries to bring odium on Balbus by referring to five
things, viz.: (l) his wealth, (2) his luxury, (3) his Tusculan estate,
(4) his entry into the Clustumine tribe, and (5) his adoption by
Theophanes.

Cap. XXVI. Quamquam: “And yet.’'

d more hominum: “after the manner of men,’' “as men always
0.ἳῖ

circulis: circulus = (l) ‘· a cire]e‚” (2) ⁴⁴ a necklace‚’' ‘⁵ chain‚''
(3) ·· a eircle'' or ‘⁴ company for social interoourse.'’ Its meaning
here is very similar to that of conviviis.

vellicant ε = ‘⁴ to pluok‚'' “ pull to pieces‚'’ ‘⁴ rail at.” similarly,
rodo, which lit. = ‘⁸ to gnaw,” means also ‘⁶ to backbite,’⁷ ‘⁶ slander.”

inimico . . . malo: a contrast between simple hostility and wicked-
ness.

§58. amicis L. Corneli: an allusion to Pompey and Caesar.

There can be no doubt that the prosecution was aimed more at them
than at Balbus

huic pertimescendi: for this ordinary use of the dat. of the agent
after gerunds, see G„ ᾧ 294.

fortunae : dat. after concesssit = “to give way.''
hominis potentissimi: Caesar.

neminem unquam: nemo is a contraction for we homo = “no
man.” Notice the repetition of the negative after nemo in non re,
non verbo, δερ. In English we dispense with the second negative.

ulterius rationis acpartis: ⁸⁶ of the other principles and party.''
