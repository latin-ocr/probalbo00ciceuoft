NOTES. 53

§8 36. conservanto: the imperative form' in -to naturally expresses
command rather than entreaty. The word comiter, = “will oblige the
Romans by preservingss 'takes off some of the sternness of the com-
mand. The imperat. form, however, xer) frequently expresses an
entreaty and not a command; e. 9., “forgive’' 07 “pardon me. '' This
tense of the imperat. is ‘by some called sutum, but it does not differ
appreciably in meaning from the prescnt; cp. ᾧ 17, memoria tenetote.
These imperative forms in -to (hoc {senus verbi) were constantly used in
laws, and in treaties also.

quo: abl. after uti.

superiore condicione: such a treaty would be called a foedus
iniquum, because the burdens or liabilities are not equal on both sides.
The Romans called a foedus “ aequam ” when the Romans had duties
to perform equa] to or more burdensome than those of the other party.
They called a foedus “ iniquum ” when the other party had the more
burdensome obligations to perform.

qui erranti comiter monstrat viam: a well-known line of Ennius,
quoted also in Cicero’s “De Offio727'8‚’' Ι. , 51. Comes beniqnz' facilis suaves
is also probably a quotation out of the same play.

§37. communiter: “in common,’' 7'.e.‚ when the 77zajestas of either
is in danger, both should j0in in aver-ting the danger.

’ si impedimur. the construction is, ‘si impedimur quominus per
populum Romanum deferamus nostris imperatoribus potestatem
tribuendorum beneficiorum virtutis causa) The first persons,
impedimur, defer amuS, and the words per populum Romanum, show that
Cicero is speaking as one of the principal members of the senate.

Cap. XVII. §38. L. Cornelium: obj. of repetentibus. legem: object
of Jusmsse populum Romanum: subj. of jussi 3.oe

de consilii sententia: see supra, §§ 11 and 19.
lege exceptum ε by the lex Gellia Cornelia.

ᾗ 39. id quod defendo : “ the very argument Ι am maintaining.'’
This meaning of defendo ( = “ I support '' or “ maintain ”) is very
common in Cicero.

legatione: an embassy from Gades, his native city, to give public
evidence as to character on behalf of the defendant. We have a
similar instance in the leqatio presented by the citizens of Heraclea 011
behalf of the poet Archias, whose claim to the Roman civitas was
impeached.

qui aprincipio: Reid reads, “qui a principio sui generis ac rei
publicae, id est ab omni studio, &c.‚ '⁹ and translates, “ away from the
source of their national existence, and of their government.” This
reading is preferable to Teubner' s, which makes a principio = ‘from
the· beginning, 'and studio rei publicae = ‘ze il for the (Roman) state!
