Marciani . . . Catuli: see ᾧῷ 34 and 35.

ara: “ an altar.’' All altars were sacred places of refuge. Those
who fled there were considered to place themselves under the proteo«
tion of the gods to whom the altars were consecrated: to injure an
enemy, or even a slave or a criminal, while he was at the altar, was a
sacrilege. Reid reads arce = “a citadel,'' regarded as a place of
safety.

Flaccus. No Horatius is known whose history suits this passage.
Porcius has been suggested, which will refer to M. Porcius Cato, who
carried on a long war in Spain. The Cassius is also hard to identify : the
