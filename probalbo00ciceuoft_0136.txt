allies endowed with surpassing valour, such as wish to asso·
ciate their own dangers with ourS. But for our allies them-
selves and those of whom we are speaking, those bound to
us by treaty, it is unjust and insulting that most trusty, most
intimate friends should be excluded from participation in
, those rewards and those clistinctionS, which are open to tribu-
taries, and 10 enemies, and often to slaves. For we see many
tributaries from Africa, Sicily, Sardinia and the other pro-
vinces on whom the citizenship has been conferred, and we
know that men, our enemies, who had deserted' to our
generals and had been of great service to our state, have been
presented with the citizenship; in fine, we very often see
slaves, whose civil riwhts, circumstances, and standing a·e

is, with citizenship—when they have done good service to ”

the state.

our generals—shall not be granted to them (the Gaditanis}
For if they, by their (lecrees or laws, had ordained that none
of their citizens should enter the camp of the generals of the
Roman people 3 that no one, on behalf of our empire, should
expose himself to deadly peril or endanger his life3 that it
should be permitted to us to use the auxiliary troops of the
Gaditani when we pleased, but that no private man, pre-

eminent in character and courage, should fight on behalt' of

our empire at his own risk3 we should rightly be aggrieved
at this, that the auxiliaries of the Roman people were being
dixninished, that the courage of the bravest men was being
crushed, that we were being deprived of the zealous sup-
portos luen of alien birth and of foreign valour. 26. And
yet, judges, there is no difference between the fact of people
bound to us hy treaty making these laws, that no one from
their several communities shall incur danger in our ware, and
the impossibility ot· our confirming those gists which we have
