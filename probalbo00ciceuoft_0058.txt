48 CICERO PRO BALBO.

and then returning to Gades ; (3) by deliberately refusing the citizen-
ship at Rome, and being enrolled at Gades.

ad causam nihil pertinet: Cicero argues throughout that the
terms of the treaty of alliance have nothing to do with the question
of Balbus' right to the citizenship.

equidem: see note, ξ 15.

longe secus: “far otherwise.” This is scarcely an appropriate
answer to the preceding question. You would expect something like,
“ For my own part I feel there is no reason at a11‚” in answer to the
question, “ What reason is there ,Ρ &c.'’ If you read ecquid est ? “is
there any reason ἓ ” Zonye secus will fit in : “ I think far otherwise,”
ism, ‘⁴ Ι think there is none.'’ The comp. of secus is secius, and the
word is probably derived from the root of sequor, “ following,”
hence “inferi01·,’' “ worse,’' “otherwise’' There is also a neut.
indecl. noun secus = sex.

ut quaeque.. .ita maxime: “ in proportion as. . . . so,’' “ the
more . . . the more.'’ Remember the distinction between quisque =
“each‚’' qnisquam = “anyone‚'’ quivis = “ any one you like,’' and
quisquis = “ whoever.’'

sponsione : an agreement was called a sponsio whenever the formal
words Spondesne ? Spondeo (“ Do you promise? Ι do ’') were used on
both sides. Notice the omission of et before foedere, in accordance
with the rule explained in ᾧ 13.

non dubitarent: “ would not hesitate.” ,Non dubito, = “ I do not
doubt‚” is generally followed by quin ‚· the acc. and inf. construction is
frequent after the Augustan period, but is not found in Cicero. Non>
dubito, = “ Ι do not hesitate‚'’ is generally followed by the infinitive,
as here.

idem . . . quod = “ the same as.'' J uris is the partitive genit.
depending on idem ‚· it differs very little in meaning from idem jus.

nos non possumus: it is important for the student to remember
that a man if he was a citizen of Rome could not at the same time be
a citizen of any other state. On the other hand, a citizen of a foreign
state could also be a citizen of any number of other foreign states
<by foreiyn state is meant any state but Rome).

ᾧ 30. Atheniensis, 8⁶0. : “ citizens of Athens, Rhodes and Lacedae-

quo errore : they saw that foreigners could be members of several
states at the same time, so they erroneously thought they could be
citizens of Athens as well as of Rome.

Athenis : for the case, and omission of preposition, see G„ § 257.
judicum: the jurors at Athens, or Ιιείίαετε, were chosen 600 from
