posed on them by us. And the facts of the case, judges,
show that these statements of mine are not hypothetical‚
but that I am expressing the actual sentiments of the
Gaditani. I say that many years ago the Gaditani, on
behalf of the state, constituted L. Cornelius their patron.
I will produce the ta11y; 1 call the ambassadors3 you see
most eminent and noble nien sent to this trial to eulogize
him, to plead against his danger, in fine, when the matter
was long ago heard of in Gades, that he would be exposed
to danger at the hands of that man, the Gaditani passed the
most weighty decrees against that man, their own fellow-
citizen. 42. Could the people of Gades more thoroughly ratify
their treaty‚ since you are so much pleased with this word,
if it ratitied it, by approving by formal vote of our decrees
and ordinances, than by constituting him their patron, so as

most worthy of the honour of our citizenship ’ἔ Could it have
put in a more decided expression of its opinion, than when it
even stigmatized his accuser with fine and punishment?
Could it have given a clearer judgment on the case than it
has done, by sending to your court a deputation of its most
distinguished citizens to testify to this man's authority, to
eulogize his life, to plead against his danger2 43. For who is
so mad as not to feel that this right must be upheld by the
Gaditani, that the road to this most honourable reward, our
citizenship, may not be barred to them for ever3 and that
they have special cause for rejoicing, in that the goodwill of
L. Cornelius here towards his fellows remains at Gades, that
his popularity and his power of speaking in their favour are
exercised in this state? For who of us is there to whom
that state is not held in higher honour by reason of this man's
zeal, solicitude, and diligeme?

XIX. I say nothing about the great distinction with which
C. Caesar, when he was praetor iu Hispania, treated this
people : how he allayed strife; how he established their laws
by their own permission3 how he effaced a long-standing
barbarism from the customs and institutions of the Gaditani 3
how, at the request of this man, he bestowed upon that state
his keenest interest, the greatest favours in his power. I pass
over many things which they obtain daily‚ either altogether,
