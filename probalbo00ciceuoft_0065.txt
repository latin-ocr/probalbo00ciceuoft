magnum bellum : the great war with Sertorius,

hoc tempore : ἐφ’.. about 58 B.('. Pompey was appointed praqfectux
annonae with extraordinary powerS, in consequence of a great scal-city
of corn at Rome. He had authority to lex-y supplies of corn for Rome
firom all towns in the Roman Empiro. Ordinarily this corn would be
paid for at a fair value, but many subject states, who were anxious to
ingratiate themselves with Rome, used to send corn a< a free gift.
Gades seems to have done this many times before.

caritate: this word, formed from vasus. prcservcs the two mnan-
i‘nggalogit‘y‘ dear''—(l) “affection,'' (2) “dearness,” “high price‚''

annonae: annona from amens, = lit. “the yearly produce‚” hence
“ means of subsistenee,'' “ corn,” hence “ the price of grain m· other
food.'’ hence “ the prices or the markets.’'

Se hoc jus esse, &o.: the constructionis, “testantur imperatores
nostros . . . et populum Romanum se hoc jus esse velle, ut locus sit in
nostris castris . . . acie, sibi et liberis si qui eximia virtute fuerint.”
-“ They call our dead generals and the Roman people to witness that
they wish the following law to exist, viz„ that there should be a
place in our camps, δῖα, for those of them and their children who
were especially brave, and that by these steps they should ascend even

sions.

hospitium publice: the Gaditani had made Balbus their public-us

tesseram: tessera (so. hospitalis) was a tally or token which was
divided between two friends, in order that by fitting the two portions
together they or their descendants might always recognise each other.
Sometimes, instead of dividing one tessera, each of thom kept one of
two similar tea-serae.

With the idea of joining the two portions of the tesserae, cp. the
English word indencure, which was a sheet of parchment or papcr divided
unevenly in two, each party preserving one part, the indentcd edge of
which naturally fitted into the other. Tea-sera literally = “ a square
tablet‚'' hence = (l) “a die‚'’ (2) “a tablet on which a watchword
was written,'' hence ‘⁴ a watchword,'' (3) “ a token between friends.”

excito : a technical word for calling witnesses.
