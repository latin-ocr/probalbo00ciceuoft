men, relates to the right all have of changing their states:
it contains nothing that applies peculiarly to religious obliga-
tions or to treaties. For Ι am maintaining the universal
proposition that there is no nation in the whole world either
so much at variance with the Roman people through some ill
will or disagreement, or so closely united to us by loyalty
and goodwill‚ as to prohibit us from adopting any one of its
citizens, or presenting him with the citizenship. 31. O excel—
lent laws, settled with heaven’s help by our forefathers at the
very origin of the Roman race l that no one of us can belong
to more than one state (for a difference of state must neces—
sarily involve a difference of legal-system) 3 that no one can
against his will be driven froin the citizenship, nor can be
kept on the roll against his will. For this is the firmest
foundation of our liberty, that each man has full control
over keeping or giving up his civil rights. This, however,
has undoubtedly chiefly helped to establish our empire and
increase the fame of the Roman people, which Romulus, the
original founder of this city‚“ taught us by his treaty with the
Sabinos, namely, that this state ought to be increased by taking
in even enemies. And through his influence and example a
liberal distribution and sharing of the citizenship was never
negl'ected by our ancestors. And so both many from Latium,
as the Tusculans and the Lanuvi-ans, and from the other
districts whole communitieS‚ such as those of the Sabines,
the Volscians‚ and the Hernicans, were admitted to the
citizenship, and. none belonging to these states who were
unwilling would have been compelled to change their citizen-
ship, nor, should any have obtained our citizenship through
the kindness of the Roman people, would their treaty have
been considered to be violated.

XIV. 32. For there are certain treaties existing‚ as those of
the Cenomani, the Insubres, the Helvetii, the Iapydas, as
well as of some barbarians from Gaul, in whose treaties this
exception has been made, that none of them shall be admitted
by us as a citizen. But if this formal exception makes it
unlawful, in cases where no exception has been made it must
necessarily be lawful. where, then, is it provided in the
Gaditanian treaty that the Roman people shall not admit a
Gaditano to the citizenshipl Nowherel And if there were
