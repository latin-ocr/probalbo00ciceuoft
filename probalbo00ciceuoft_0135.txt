PRO L. C. BALBO ORATIO. 9

with wills, Q. Voconius one dealing with the right of women
to inherit property 3 innumerable other enactments were pro-
posed concerning the rights of citizenship : the Latius adopted
which of these they chose. Lastly, by the Julian law itself,
the citizenship was extended to the allies and the Latius on
this condition, that those peoples who had not expressed
their assent to the laws should not have the citizenship.

’ And in regard to this point there was much discussion amongst

the people of Heraclea and Neapolis, since very many in
those states preferred the liberty they enjoyed under their
treaty to the rights of citizenship. Lastly‚ this is the import

ailianae, of friendship, of treaty is this of yourS, if in its hour
of danger our state must not have as its defendet a Massiliam
or a Gaditane, or a Saguntiae? Or if, should anyone from
among these peoples have arisen who has aided our leaders
by the help of his labour, who has recruited their supplies at
his own personal risk, who has often contended hand to hand
in battle with our enemies, who has osten exposed himself to
the weapons of the enemy, to struggles for life, to danger of
death, it should, on no terms whatever, be possible that this
man should be rewarded with the citizenship? 24. And, in-
