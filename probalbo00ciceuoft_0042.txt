32 CICERO PRO BALBO.

· fuerint: generic subjunctive.
minus ε Cicero often uses this word as a milder form of non.
habenda z “ by esteeming it a favour,” i.e.‚ “ by acknowledging it.”

fuefilt: subjunct. in dependent interrogative sentence, depending
on ci( e atur.

Pompei: for the termination cp. note on Corneli in {s 1.

gravitas: ‘⁶ weight‚’' “weightiness‚’' from qravz's. facultas, from
facilis, = “easy fiow of speech,’' “ eloquence.''

exemplis: “ precedents,’' previous instances of the enfranchise-
ment of a foreigner like Balbus.

foederibus: one difficulty in this case was that Gades had allied
itself to Rome under a certain foedus, and the prosecution contended

{blatslffacllbus' enfranchisement could take place only in aecordanoe with
is oe us.

inlustriore auctoritate: ‘⁴ with brighter and elearer authority.”

This adverbia] phrase, like memoria majore, corresponds to the adverbs
subtilius and peritius.

modestius: “more moderately.'’ This word comes from modus, a
limit. ·

crimine 2 crimen in Cicero generally means an accusati0n; the later
meaning, ‘ ‘ crime ” or “ fault,’' is rare in ante-Augustan prose. The

word is derived from cerno, “to decide '' or “distinguish,” and
originally meant a “ judicial deeision.''

Οωῷῃὲἐὲ ἰὲὲιξίἐ “the following‚'' i.e., “omnia se recte dare ei qui
, .

non nulli : “ some people‚'' i.e.‚ the Stoics‚ who held that every-
thing a wise man did was right.

comprehendisset: subjunct.‚ dependent sentence in Or. obliqua.

recte se dare: this is Madvig’s correction for the MS. reading,
tractare, and means “ put themselves rightly‚” i.e., “turn out
rightly ” ; Reid suggests reete cadere, which is less unlike tractare than
se dare, and means “ fall rightly,” “ happen or turn out rightly.”

quae goes with ubertas, &c.—“ for what richness, δια, could have
been greater ?''

potuit : notice the graphic indic„ when we should ordinarily have
the subjunctive.

nato ad ε “ born for,’' i.e., ‘⁴ with a natural talent for.'¹
temporis: partitive genitive after tantum.

quantum is the acc. of duration of time after conquievit ‚· tantum,
however, is the direct object of impertire.

ᾧ 4. quo: “whereiore.”
