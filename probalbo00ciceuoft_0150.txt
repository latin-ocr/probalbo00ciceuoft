of generals were of authority? Are we, then, to think that
the Latin peoples ratified either the Servilian laW, or all the
other laws by which the reward of the citizenship was held
out to the men of Latium, in return for services of some kind
or other2 55. Learn now the decision of the senate, which
has always been confirmed by the decision of the people. Our
fathers, judges, wished that the rites of Ceres should be
performed with the greatest scrupulousness and ceremony3
and since these rites had been introduced from Greece, they
were always presided over by Grecian priestesses‚ and all the
terms used were Greek. But while they chose from Greece
her who was to teach and perform this Greek worship, still
they wished that a citizen should perform the rites on· behalf
of the citizens, that she might pray to the immortal Gods
with the superior knowledge of a foreigner and an alien, but
with the feelings of a native and a citizen. I see that these
priestesses were generally natives of Neapolis or Velia, un-
doubtedly members of federate states. 1 pass over the older
instances. I quote this, that immediately before the citizen-
ship was conferred on the people of Velia, C. Valerius
Flaccus, the Praetor Urbanus in accordance with a resolution
of the senate, proposed Calliphana, a woman of Velia, by
name to the people for the citizenship. Are we, then, to
suppose either that the Velienses were ratifiers of the proposal,
or that that priestess was not made a Roman citizen, or that
the treaty was violated both by the senate and by the Roman
eople'.l

which leaves so little room for doubt, much more has been
said, and said by more men most skilled in these matters,
than the occasion demanded. But this has been done, not
that we might demonstrate to you by our words a matter so
sels-evident‚ but that we might discourage all the malevo-
lent‚ the unfair. and the jealous; and that the accuser might
excite such feelings, that certain speechcs of men who are
distressed by the prosperity of others might reach even your
ears and abeund in the court itself. For this reason you saw
those accusations mingled with the greatest skill in every
part of his speech 2——now about the wealth of L. Cornelius,
which is not so great as to be worth envyhrg, and which,
