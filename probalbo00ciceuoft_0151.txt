PRO L. c, nimo ORATIO. ' ‘25

however great it may be, is of such a nature as to seem rather
to have been acquired by saving than by greed 3 now about
his luxury, which was not stigmatized by any specific charge
of riotous living, but by a general evil report; now about his
Tusculan mansion, which he (the accuser) remembered to
have belonged to Q Metellus and L. Crassus, and that Crassus
had bought it from a freed man, Soterieus Marcius 3. that it
had come into Metellus's possession out of the property of
Vennonius Vindicius he did not remember. And he also

a most powerful man in times of great trouble and'discord in
our state, he has never offended any one of those who held
different views or belonged to the other party, by any act, or
