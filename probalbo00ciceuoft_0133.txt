Pno L. c. BALBO ORATIO. 7

subject to oiu- sway, whom the Roman people had distin-
guished with unprecedented and singular honours; it· now in
our day that which he had done were said to have been done
in violation of a treaty‚ who would listen to the charge?
Assuredly no one. For death would have killed jealousy,
while his achievements would rest upon the glory of an ever-
lasting fame. Are his highsqualities, then, which if we only
heard of them could not be called in question, to he railed at
by the voice of detractors, because they are present to our

VJI. 17. Now, for the rest of mv speech, I will make no
mention of Pompey3 but do yon, gentlemen of the jury, keep
him in your minds and memories. I will refresh your recol-

any hostile feeling. If each of ηε, judges, in whatever
position he was born, in whatever condition he was placed at
birth, were obliged to remain in this same station of life until
old age, and if all whom either good luck has raised or their
own labour and industry have made famous were to be
punished, this laW, these conditions of life, would not seem
to be more oppressive in their effect upon L. Cornelius than
upon many good and worthy men. But if, however, the
virtue, the ability, the culture of many who have risen from
the lowest class, from the meanest grade of fortune, has pro-
cured for them not only friendships and abundance of house-
hold goodS‚ but the highest reputation‚ distinctions, renown
